May show:
1. general tendency of the focal variable over time (e.g. trajectory of popularity of the average product in a category);
2. distribution of the focal variable at multiple points in time (histogram, where bins=months/years)
3. evolution of the focal variable for specific cases (e.g. specific products);
4. differences/similarities in 1, 2, and 3 across categories of entities (e.g. types of products).

Must show:
1. trajectory in the count of ratings received by product across time (since the very first score up to six months later; exclude products whose first score has been posted by less than six months);
2. association between the trajectory in the count of ratings and product attributes (e.g., product-market category, price);
3 association between the trajectory in the count of ratings and the timing/pace with which ratings are posted.

Question: how/why count of ratings develops around new products. 
(i) to speculate about the factors that account for the trajectory in the count of ratings; 
(ii) to update their client with a PowerPoint alike slide-show.

Must use:
1. raw data, statistical indexes, or the outcome of statistical analyses (e.g., regression analysis; network analysis);
2. both the 'review' and the 'metadata' datasets

Deliverables:
copy of Python scripts and/or the Jupyter notebook
copy of the final chart (.pdf format)
supporting documentation (.md/.tex format) reporting:
a justification of the critical design decisions against the visualization wheel proposed in Cairo's book;
an effective, concise description of the key insights emerging from the figure;
the set of statistical analyses (if any) behind the charts.
